## Rift
Rift is a multipurpose Discord bot allowing you to manage your Discord server, flexibly.
Rift offers many services, such as:

### Updates & Contributing
I don't plan to update/maintain this much. This project was just supposed to be a way for
me to improve my web development skills and get better with Python and its APIs.

You are open to freely contribute as much as you'd like to.

### Hosting
The web panel will be hosted via Vercel until I can figure out
what's going on with Ionos.
